# Flexible Catalog – JSON + Virtual Columns 🚀

A **product catalog** where *JSON columns* hold dynamic attributes, exposed by **virtual/persistent columns** for indexing and fast filters — giving the agility of **semi-structured data** with the performance of relational indexes.

**Problem**: e-commerce and marketplace catalogs have many product-specific attributes (RAM, GPU, screen_size, battery_mAh, etc.) which vary by category. Storing every attribute as a column is inflexible; storing a blob of JSON is flexible but usually performs poorly for filters unless indexed.

**Solution**: Keep a JSON column (specs) for flexible attributes. Expose a selected set of frequently-filtered paths as virtual (generated) columns and add indexes on them (BTREE) or persistent indexes to speed up range/eq searches. Keep JSON for everything else.

This repository is a full example: database schema (`schema.sql`), a data generator to produce 300k rows (`load_data.py`), a small Express API (`/api`) that prefers generated columns for filters, and a Docker Compose setup to run everything locally.

---

This project solves real-world problems:

* Handling dynamic product attributes without rigid schema changes.
* Enabling fast filtering and sorting on frequently queried fields.
* Scaling data ingestion for large datasets (300k+ rows).
* Maintaining data integrity and validation even with semi-structured JSON.
* Providing an API that safely exposes complex queries while preventing injection or malformed requests.

---

# Built with:

MariaDB / MySQL 8.0+ (JSON support + generated columns)

Node.js + Express (API with validation + metrics)

Docker Compose (for reproducible setup)

Python (Faker) for synthetic data generation

## 🌟 Project Overview

Hybrid database design where:

* Product attributes (RAM, GPU, screen size, battery, etc.) are stored as **JSON**.
* Frequently queried attributes are extracted as **generated columns** for **B-tree indexing**.
* Full API layer enables **complex filters** (e.g., `ram >= 16`, `gpu = "RTX 4070"`).
* Supports high-volume data ingestion efficiently via SQL inserts or CSV + `LOAD DATA INFILE`.
* Provides built-in **analytics views** and constraints for robust data validation.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flexible-catalog.git
cd flexible-catalog
```

### 2. Configure Environment

Copy `.env.example` → `.env` and set database/API credentials:

```
DB_HOST=db
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=root
DB_NAME=catalog
PORT=3000
```

### 3. Start Services via Docker

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

API: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
DB: localhost:3306

### 4. Load Database Schema

```bash
mysql -h127.0.0.1 -P3306 -u root -proot < schema.sql
```

### 5. Generate and Load Data

```bash
python3 load_data.py
```

* Produces `products_inserts.sql` and `products.csv`

**Option A – Fast CSV Import**

```sql
LOAD DATA INFILE '/absolute/path/products.csv'
INTO TABLE products
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS
(name, category, price, specs);
```

**Option B – SQL Inserts (slower)**

```bash
mysql -h127.0.0.1 -P3306 -u root -proot < products_inserts.sql
```

---

## 📡 API Usage

### Base URL

```
http://localhost:3000
```

### Endpoints

**Search Products – filter by attributes:**

```http
POST /products/search
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "filters": [
    { "field": "ram", "op": ">=", "value": 16 },
    { "field": "gpu", "op": "=", "value": "RTX 4070" }
  ],
  "page": 1,
  "pageSize": 20
}
```

### Example Response

```json
[
  {
    "id": 101,
    "name": "laptop-101",
    "category": "laptop",
    "price": 1299.99,
    "ram_gb": 16,
    "gpu": "RTX 4070"
  }
]
```

---

## 📊 Benchmarking

* JSON-only query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE JSON_EXTRACT(specs, '$.ram') >= 16;
```

* Virtual-column indexed query (fast):

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE ram_gb >= 16;
```

Virtual columns: **3–10× faster** on 300k+ rows.

---

## 🛠️ Advanced Features & Technical Details

* **Constraints**: JSON validation, numeric fields, positive price.
* **Triggers**: normalize JSON on insert, auto-update timestamps.
* **Views**: `product_summary` for analytics.
* **Middleware**: validates filters before hitting DB.
* **Logging**: query execution times via `morgan`.
* **Healthchecks**: Docker ensures service recovery.
* **Scalable Data Ingestion**: CSV bulk load for large datasets.

**Problems Solved:**

* Flexible schema for dynamic attributes.
* Fast search/filtering on common fields.
* Data consistency in semi-structured datasets.
* Safe API interface preventing invalid queries.

---

## 🧪 Troubleshooting & Fallbacks

* **CSV Import Error** → check MySQL `secure_file_priv`. Ensure file path is correct and accessible.
* **Docker container restarts** → check `.env` DB settings; verify ports and credentials.
* **Slow inserts** → prefer CSV import over SQL inserts.
* **API returns errors** → verify request payload and filters; check server logs.
* **Database connection issues** → ensure DB container is running and accessible; retry connection.
* **Schema load fails** → check MySQL version compatibility (8.0+ or MariaDB 10.6+).

For persistent issues, consult logs in Docker containers (`docker logs <container>`) and ensure all dependencies meet version requirements.

---

## 📝 Next Steps / Stretch Goals

* Full-text search for JSON specs.
* GraphQL API support.
* Compare PostgreSQL JSONB vs MySQL JSON for performance.
* Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring.

## 🚀 Quick start (local)

1. Clone the repo and enter the folder:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd flexible-catalog
```

2. Copy the `.env` values (or create a `.env` file):

```env
DB_HOST=db
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=catalog_user
DB_PASS=SecurePass123!
DB_NAME=catalog
PORT=3000
```

3. Start services with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

4. Generate demo data (example generates 300k products):

```bash
python load_data.py
```

5. Load generated SQL into MySQL (run after DB is up):

```bash
docker exec -i catalog_db mysql -uroot -p$DB_PASS $DB_NAME < products_inserts.sql
```

6. Health check the API:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

## 🧱 Database schema (high level)

* `products` table stores common columns (id, name, category, price, created_at, updated_at) and a `specs` JSON column.
* Virtual/generated columns (stored) are created from JSON paths for fields like `ram_gb`, `storage_gb`, `gpu`, `brand`, `screen_size`, `battery_mah`, and indexed for fast filtering.
* A `product_summary` view provides category-level analytics.

See `schema.sql` for the full DDL, triggers, and view definitions.

---

## 🛠 Data generation

* `load_data.py` generates mock products across categories (laptop, phone, tablet, desktop) and can produce:

  * `products_inserts.sql` (batched INSERTs)
  * `products.csv` (for `LOAD DATA INFILE`)
* Use `requirements.txt` to install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🔌 API (overview)

* Built with Express + `mysql2/promise` and secured with helmet, compression, and logging.

### Key endpoints

* `GET /health` — health check
* `GET /products` — paginated list of products
* `POST /products/search` — complex search with `filters`, `sort`, `page`, `pageSize`
* `GET /products/:id` — product by ID
* `GET /analytics/summary` — category-level analytics (uses the `product_summary` view)

### Example search

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/products/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"filters":[{"field":"ram","op":">=","value":32},{"field":"category","op":"=","value":"laptop"}], "page":1, "pageSize":10}'
```

---

## 🧪 Testing & verification

Sample queries to validate behavior:

```bash
# Laptops with >= 32GB RAM
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/products/search -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"filters":[{"field":"ram","op":">=","value":32},{"field":"category","op":"=","value":"laptop"}]}'

# High-end GPUs
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/products/search -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"filters":[{"field":"gpu","op":"in","value":["RTX 4080","RTX 4090"]}]}'

# Analytics summary
curl http://localhost:3000/analytics/summary
```

---

## 📈 Performance notes (demo targets)

* **JSON-path queries** (direct JSON_EXTRACT without indexes) are slower and should be avoided for hot filters.
* **Generated columns + B-tree indexes** deliver 5–10x faster lookups for commonly filtered attributes.
* Tune DB pool size, indexes, and hardware for production-scale traffic.

---

## 🎯 Hackathon pitch (ready-to-read)

> We built a flexible catalog system that solves the real challenge e-commerce platforms face: managing diverse product attributes without sacrificing performance. Using a hybrid approach (JSON flexibility + SQL indexing), we can query 300k products in milliseconds while allowing the addition of new attributes without schema changes. The system is fully containerized, includes a RESTful API, and ships with a demo data generator.

---

## ✅ Unique selling points

* No schema migrations required for new attributes — just add JSON.
* B-tree indexed virtual columns for blazing-fast filtering.
* Production-ready practices: health checks, connection pooling, validation, and logging.
